/*
 * This file manages the benchmark timer used by the RTEMS Timing Test

 * benchmark_timer_read() usually returns the number of microseconds
 * since benchmark_timer_initialize() exitted.
 *
 *  NOTE: It is important that the timer start/stop overhead be
 *        determined when porting or modifying this code.
